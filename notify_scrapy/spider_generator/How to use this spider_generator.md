# How to use this spider_generator

1. cd to this derectory
2. put your config files (only .json .yml .yaml can be supported) in the folder *configs*
3. modify variable address in generator.py
4. use order like 'python generator.py' or 'py generator.py' in your terminal
5. The .py files can be found in the folder *output_py*

The code in generator.py line 9 is just for test, if you want to 
use generator.py, remember to modify it.

More details can be found in generator.py 

Since the developer may change the .py files in folder *spiders* individually, so do not ctrl+C all the files in the output_py and ctrl+V in folder *spiders*
