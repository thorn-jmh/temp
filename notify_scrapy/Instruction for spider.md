# Instruction for spider

The .py in the folder *spider_generator* is not equal to the .py in the folder *spider*

So it's very very dangerous to paste the files directly.

Many of files in the folder *spider* need to be updated by adding **max_sticky**, or it can't work normally.

If you need to change the pages to be crawled, we prefer to change yaml first, then use the spider generator to create .py in the folder *spider_generator/output_py* then copy the changing pages' class and paste them in the true spider folder.

GOOD LUCK !
